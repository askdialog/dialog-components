fix(product-block): suppress English placeholder flash during suggestions fetch (OPS-589)

`DialogProductBlock` no longer renders English default placeholders (`"Your expert"`, `"A question about this product?"`, `"Ask anything..."`) while `getSuggestions` is in flight. Title, description, and input placeholder render empty until the localized response arrives, eliminating the visible English → target-language re-render on multi-locale storefronts. Also hardens the fetch lifecycle: resets loading state on each `productId`/`client` change, clears loading in `finally` on errors, and guards against out-of-order responses overwriting newer data.
