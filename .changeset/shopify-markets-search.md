feat(search): carry the storefront market on search requests and render market pricing

`SearchRequest` gains optional `locale` (BCP 47) and `countryCode` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2): the backend answers with localized product titles and the Shopify Market's prices. `createSearchController` accepts the same options and stamps them on every request; `dialog.search()` defaults them from the instance's `locale`/`countryCode`. `SearchProduct` gains an optional `compareAtPriceRange` (always in `priceRange`'s currency).

React/Vue: `DialogSearchResults` (and the product card) accept an optional `locale` prop so prices format with the storefront's conventions instead of the browser's, and render the compare-at price struck through when it beats the displayed price. `useDialogSearch` accepts `locale`/`countryCode` and forwards them to the controller.
